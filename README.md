android-square-progressbar
==========================

# General idea
The idea came when I needed a way to display a progressbar in a clever way in my quiz app. There I have a square image and some text below it. But no more space for a progressbar. So the best way would be a progressbar around the image.

## Square image
So this is what I want to look like when it's finished:

## Rectangular image
This should work for rectangular images too:

## Customizable
The color of the progressbar can be set easy. See http://developer.android.com/design/style/color.html
